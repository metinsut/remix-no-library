# Custom Implementation Examples in Remix

This project demonstrates how to implement common web application features from scratch without relying on external libraries. The goal is to provide clean, maintainable, and type-safe implementations of features that are often handled by third-party packages.

## Features

### 🔐 Authentication (Ready)
A custom authentication system built from scratch using:
- Session-based authentication

### 🎨 Theme Management (Ready)
- Dark/light mode switching
- Theme persistence
- System theme detection 
- Custom hooks for theme control
- Better implement system theme detection (TODO)

### 🌐 Internationalization (Coming Soon)
- Language switching
- Translation management
- RTL support
- Custom i18n hooks

### 🔔 Toast Notifications (Coming Soon)
- Shadcn/UI toast(sonner)
- Queue management
- Accessibility support

## Why Custom Implementations?

1. **Better Control**: Full control over the implementation and behavior
2. **Smaller Bundle Size**: No external dependencies to load
3. **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for better developer experience
4. **Learning Opportunity**: Understanding how these features work under the hood
5. **Customization**: Easy to modify and extend based on project needs
